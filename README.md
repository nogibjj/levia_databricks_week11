# Databricks Data Pipeline Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates the creation of an end-to-end data pipeline using Databricks. It involves ingesting, transforming, and analyzing data, specifically focusing on a dataset provided in the Databricks tutorial.

## Steps
1. **Data Ingestion**: Raw data is loaded into a Databricks table using Auto Loader.
2. **Data Preparation**: The raw data is transformed by filtering and adding new fields.
3. **Data Analysis**: SQL queries are used to analyze the transformed data.
4. **Automation**: A Databricks job is set up to automate the entire pipeline.

## Demonstrating the Pipeline
- **Ingestion**: Data from the dataset is ingested and stored in a table.
- **Preparation**: Data is then prepared by selecting necessary columns and adding a timestamp.
- **Analysis**: Various analytical queries are run on the prepared data to extract insights.
- **Job Creation**: Finally, a Databricks job is created to orchestrate these steps.

## Usage
To use this pipeline:
1. Set up a Databricks cluster.
2. Create and run the provided notebooks in the order: ingestion, preparation, analysis.
3. Configure the Databricks job to automate the pipeline.

## Note
This project is based on the Databricks tutorial. Adaptations may be necessary for different datasets or specific use cases.
